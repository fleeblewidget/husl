This repo holds the core language specification and quick reference guide for HUSL, a structured, unambiguous specification language designed to be understandable by non-technical stakeholders. HUSL specifications can be used to precisely define implementation details for both human and AI coding.

HUSL is designed to be usable for green field development, but is also suitable for reverse engineering from legacy codebases to allow for reasoning about refactoring, upgrades and architectural improvements.

In addition to the language specifications, a selection of sample AI prompts for working with LLM code generation are provided.
